Capstone Project
Intial Project Ideas



Three potential ideas for Capstone Projects(Titles and Blurbs):

Project 1. Movie Recommendation

Background: People like to watch movies that has similar gener\director\actor test. Based on users input, we can provide movie recommandation very similar to Netflix.

The Aim: To identify the best statistical techniques for predicting movie preference(s).

Data: GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site. There are datasets for 100K to 20 M movie ratings. http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. There are various data set in different size and different 

Project 2. Is US really loosing the grip on Innovation?

Background: Many people\leaders in US claims that US is loosing against new comer such as China in Innovation. Let's find out, will it be able to regain it's position or it is too late to reverse the trend. 

Data: Quandl's API provides the data for all the patent filed by various contries and corporation. 

Project 3. Predictive Modeling for system failure
Data: With Distributed systems comes the complexity of maintaing the system up and running 24/7. Right now, most of the monitoring tools are based on set threasold but what if we can build and predictive model that provides alert to support team few hours in advance to prevent wide outage. This is very helpful where systems are on cloud. 

My preference would be project 1,2 then 3.
